#### Goals:

- Build a PC capable of training ML models locally and run AAA games smoothly.
- Learn in general about computer parts and how to build a computer from scratch.

#### Design Constrains:

- Small Form Factor (basically I wanted a fairly small PC that is easy to travel with) [^1]
- Max $1500 USD (I wanted the cost to be less than the lowest spec MacBook Pro)

#### Process

I had no prior experience building a PC so the initial stages of the project consisted on going through various reddit posts to figure out what makes a PC and how do you even start building it (where to purchase parts, what prices are good per each part, etc.) [^2].

Generally, the parts that make a PC are the following:

- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- GPU (Graphics Card)
- Motherboard
- RAM (Memory)
- Storage (Long Term Memory)
- PSU (Power Supply Unit)
- Case
- CPU Fans

To start, it is generally recommended to purchase first the CPU and GPU since those parts tend to be the most expensive ones (and will dictate the compatibility of other parts, like the motherboard).

I used [PC Parts Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) to keep track of my parts and to make sure they were all compatible. I purchased parts in Amazon, Newegg, and sometimes directly from the manufacturer's website (in particular for the GPU). I found the [buildapcsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/) subreddit super useful for finding good deals. Procuring the parts took me approximately 3 months since I waited for some parts to be put on discount. I used [CamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com) to track prices on Amazon.

I ended up with the following build:

Once the parts arrived, I watched some tutorials and built it. I found these videos to be super helpful:

[^1]: I didn't realize this at first, but there are not a lot of options for good motherboards for small form factor PCs. This should not be a problem for less powerful CPUs but if you are aiming for a high performance SFF PC, you will most likely have to pay a premium price for a good motherboard.
[^2]: If I had to figure this out again, I would use [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai). It is a program that uses LLMs to browse the web and synthesize information from various sources. It has a feature to browse only reddit post which would have been very useful for synthesizing information.
